# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.

# Purpose
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We are using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we’ll oversample the data using the **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE** algorithms, and undersample the data using the **ClusterCentroids** algorithm. Then, we’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the **SMOTEENN** algorithm. Next, we’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**, to predict credit risk. 

In the end, we’ll evaluate the performance of these models to make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
